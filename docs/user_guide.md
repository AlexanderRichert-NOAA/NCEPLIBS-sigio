# NCEPLIBS-sigio

This library provides an Application Program Interface for performing
I/O on the sigma restart file of the global spectral model. Functions
include opening, reading, writing, and closing as well as allocating
and deallocating data buffers used in the transfers. The I/O performed
here is sequential. The transfers are limited to header records or
data records.

This is part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS)
project.
